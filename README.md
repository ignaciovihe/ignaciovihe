# Hi, my name is Ignacio Vidal. ¬°Welcome! 

### Computer engineer and passionate about software development.

I have focused my life on technology, especially in the field of computer science.  I am currently a Technical Engineer in Management Informatics and a Computer Science graduate.
Since 2016, I have run my own company providing maintenance and consulting services to businesses and individuals. At the beginning of 2025, I decided to make a significant change in my life and move to Germany. Currently, I dedicate my time to learn what truly excites me: software development.
